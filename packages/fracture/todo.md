# TODO

## CLI Features
- [ ] Add `--install-deps` (or similar) CLI option to automatically install plugins/libraries needed to run a collection
  - Should analyze collection dependencies and install required plugins + external libraries (should we have separate flags ? plugin + libs)
  - Could integrate with plugin discovery/resolution system
  - Should support both npm and other package managers
