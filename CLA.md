# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

Thank you for your interest in contributing to ApiQuest! We appreciate your time and effort.

## Why We Need a CLA

ApiQuest uses a dual-licensing model:
- **Open Source**: AGPL-3.0-or-later for community use
- **Commercial**: Alternative licensing for businesses that need different terms

**This enables dual licensing and keeps the project sustainable.** The CLA allows HumanHub LLC to offer commercial licenses while ensuring the open-source version remains freely available under AGPL-3.0.

## What You're Agreeing To

By signing this CLA, you confirm that:

1. **You own the rights** to the code you're contributing, or you have permission to contribute it
2. **You grant HumanHub LLC** a license to use your contribution under both AGPL-3.0-or-later and alternative commercial licenses
3. **Your contribution remains open source** under AGPL-3.0-or-later for the community
4. **You retain your copyright** - you still own your code and can use it however you like

## What We're NOT Asking

- We're **NOT** asking for ownership of your code - you keep your copyright
- We're **NOT** restricting how you can use your own code elsewhere
- We're **NOT** asking for anything beyond the rights needed to maintain dual licensing

## How to Sign

We use an automated CLA bot that will prompt you when you submit your first pull request. The process is simple:

1. Submit your pull request
2. The CLA bot will comment with a link
3. Review and sign the CLA (takes about 1 minute)
4. Your signature is recorded and you're all set

You only need to sign once, and it applies to all your future contributions to ApiQuest.
